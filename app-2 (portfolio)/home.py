    I am Maamoun Chebbi, a passionate and dedicated Junior Software Engineer
    with a strong focus on back-end development. With a background in both
    software engineering and graphic design, I bring a unique 
    blend of creativity and technical expertise to every project I undertake.

    I specialize in developing robust and scalable web applications, leveraging
    a range of technologies including JavaScript, TypeScript, Angular, Node.js,
    and Python. My experience includes building user-friendly interfaces 
    and efficient back-end systems, as well as integrating secure payment 
    solutions and managing complex databases.
    
    In addition to my technical skills, I have a strong foundation in graphic design,
    which allows me to contribute to the visual and user experience 
    aspects of the projects I work on. My design work spans across 
    various mediums, from digital media to print, ensuring that every
    project is visually engaging and aligned with the brandâ€™s identity.
